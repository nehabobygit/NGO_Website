This project focuses on designing and developing a responsive and visually appealing NGO website aimed at promoting child welfare initiatives. The site’s primary goal is to raise awareness, encourage donations, recruit volunteers, and inspire adoption to support underprivileged children. Built using HTML for content structure and CSS for styling, the website integrates images, videos, CSS grid layouts, animations, and responsive design techniques to ensure accessibility across devices. It showcases the NGO’s mission, programs, gallery, and ways to get involved in an engaging manner. The final product is an intuitive, user-friendly platform that effectively communicates the organization’s values and impact, while making it easy for visitors to contribute through donations, volunteering, or adoption. This enhances community engagement and facilitates long-term support for children in need.<img width="746" height="225" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e9a53e7-ceb1-4b8d-9ac7-4ba47ec15b9f" />
